This includes the analysis of 3 different datasets on 
1. information regarding alcohol consumption in different countries
2. statistics from a Euro 2012 football tournament
3. breast cancer dataset
We only infer solutions of some basic questions from the first two datasets, and the goal is to predict malignancy of tumors using a optimal decision tree classifier for the third dataset.
